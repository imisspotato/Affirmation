#Ayira's Affirmations
This is a 'Words of affirmation' web application that uses the OpenAI API to give my girlfriend words of affirmation. I created this as a birthday gift for her as one of her love languages is words of affirmation. It is deployed on vercel and it is serverless hence no backend is required.
#Front-end infrastructure
The app has been created using Typescript, tailwind CSS and Next.js. The app uses Express.js for serverless functionality. This allows us to use Next-auth for authentication and connect with OPENAI API. The data is stored on MongoDB. The template and User Interface was forked from @javascript mastery.
