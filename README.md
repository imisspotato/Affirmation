This is a personal project to make prompts that uses next-auth for authentication

The app has been created using Typescript, tailwind CSS and Next.js. The app uses Express.js for serverless functionality. This allows us to use Next-auth for authentication and connect with OPENAI API. The data is stored on MongoDB. The template and User Interface was forked from @javascript mastery.
